# Changelog

## 0.6.5 - 2026-07-03

- Added structured JSON result envelopes for host commands, including `--json`
  output on supported user-facing commands.
- Added selector-miss diagnostics with same-kind candidates from the current
  snapshot.
- Added `reticle ui outline`, short-lived `@N` aliases, and `reticle act
  --alias` for faster agent-driven targeting.
- Added a `reticle serve` helper broker so commands can reuse the daemon-hosted
  helper through `--use-daemon` or `RETICLE_USE_DAEMON=1`.
- Added runtime process advisories, persisted process-state, and matching
  serve-panel cues.
- Added repeated-item ordinal hints to UI outlines and alias cache entries.
- Added `reticle act batch` for ordered action sequences from a JSON file.

Validation:

- Swift host tests.
- Android helper tests.
- Plugin manifest/version-lockstep validation.
- GitHub CI for all optimization pull requests.
